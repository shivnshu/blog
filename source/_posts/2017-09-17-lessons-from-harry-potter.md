Harry Potter series, one of the most celebrated set of books of all times, always have more to see than meets the eyes. Apart from spectacular fantasy world, brilliant writing and interesting plot, you will observe many unobvious moral lessons.

* **You are not your illness**

Remus Lupin, a werewolves, did not go to exile like other werewolves. Instead, he conceals his illness and leads a normal life by preparing for full moon days. As mentioned in [Pottermore](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/remus-lupin), Lupin condition is the metaphor of those illnesses that carry a stigma, like HIV and AIDS. He teaches us that whatever disorder or illness one may have, it is important not to define onself based on it but rather rise above it.

* **Challenging the norms**

HP fantany world has many parallels with the real world. The discrimination of muggle born wizards is analogous to many form of discrimination such as casteism, sexism, recism etc. The treatment of house-elves is a depiction of slavery. The rise of Lord Voldemort and the elimination of non-pureblooded wizards remind us of Dictators and Holocaust.

Not only does HP portray these problems, it also makes reader to look for such things and fix them. Even though, in HP, it never occured to most peoples to empathise with house-elves, Harry found a way to free Dobby and Hermione fought for their rights. The propaganda of Voldemort and death eater's teach us not to be swayed by eloquent speeches. It is extremely important to not blindly follow the norm and to actively look for problems in society.
